# courseWork_06_weatherDashboard

# Description
This application allows the user to enter in a city of their choice and receive current weather information along with an abbreviated five day forecast. The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather Data API to pull this information and dynamically creates the display via JQuery. User inputs are stored locally and displayed for future use. 

The app is available for use on at the below GitHub Page link.

# User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

# Future Development
I would like to implement a more robust five day forecast that captures more information for the user. In addtion, I would like to add some verification features for the user input along with some different stylings. Use of a paid API would also allow for further feature implementation such as radars and other common ammenities found on popular weather websites/applications.
